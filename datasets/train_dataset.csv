It's complicated how I got here unfazed and unfaded A simple prayer led to my soul becoming confiscated By God, I guess I'm just now ready to be taken I've been praying for years, it felt like nothing happened Maybe my heart wasn't ready, my confidence was lackin' Even my holiest times cannot compare to this it's Beauty beyond what is Earthly, it's not implicit I'm on my knees for what feels like an eternity And resolutions of my strife now occur to me Maybe I'm too full of pride, inherently I'm selfish And for my whole life I've tried to hide the cards I've dealt with A wall of shame and agony I buried in my heart And now it's broken down in light of all this Holy art I see the good in me, I'll throw away the bad The shovel I have used for digging now lays in the grass And this carcinogen is a reminder of my past The love that my heart demands, it will last longer than me Can you feel the weight of it all? So while you're here I hope I can answer your questions You've been shorthanded left and right but my truth is ambidextrous It's no secret I preach unity, it's all inside my message Your confessions, they're meaningful so let this be your lesson We are one in my Son and hatred's a gate for misperception But the dark isn't me, rather it's the lack of People turn on my word and wonder why I back off If you don't choose me, tell me why I'd be in your life I will discipline my children but you have to think twice And those who choose the black hole forever make up their minds I'm a loving father, who won't leave children behind Those who follow me as such are given purpose and fulfillment Cause my plan for them is permanent, I just need to instill it You have purpose, you have purpose don't you forget And you will do what is best for you, don't you think you're exempt From my love, I even love the man on that road He thought he was left for dead, but if he held out his hope A true neighbor was on the way, just around the corner My son would have arrived to bring his life peace and order He's had it hard on this planet, he would thrive in my Heaven Where the fruits are the purest and the bread is unleavened But he chose impatience, took his life in his hands And now his memory is all but left to wind in the sand It takes a lot to know a person but I know he had hope Just gave it up on impulse and became spiritually broke The lesson I'm here to teach you while you're here in my presence Is that the answers can be tough to swallow but they're embedded Inside my truth, and for that you can't take them for granted Life's a maze and it can take my wisdom to understand it There's a lot you still don't know, but in time you will learn And you can stay inside my light as I leave you with these words Love your children love your brothers, make sure that they don't stumble Always put my glory first and don't forget to be humble I love you Can you feel the weight of it all?",en,Rock

It goes and goes: To the south as to the north, To the east as to the west. Tentative light comes over the earth, Dispelling darkness. Roaches and crickets and fleas And fluttering nocturnal moths Rush off to their nests in fear Of chachalacas and pigeons, Turtle doves and partridges, Little pheasants, crows and mockingbirds, While red ants rush about busy. These wild birds begin their song For dew gives birth to happiness. Venus, the beautiful star, Shimmers over the trees, Smoking as it dips down the sky, And the moon fades to nothing Above the green expanse of forest. The holiday begins, Bringing joy to our village, For the sun, renewed, Has come to illuminate the lives Of all the souls who live united Here, in our village. (Songs of Dzitbalché 11)",en,

Is everybody in? Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin Wake up! You can't remember where it was Had this dream stopped? The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken We were afraid to touch it The sheets were hot dead prisms And she was beside me Old, she's no, young Her dark red hair, the white soft skin Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom Look! she's coming in here I can't live through each slow century of her moving I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile Feel the good cold stinging blood The smooth hissing snakes of rain Once I had a little game I liked to crawl back in my brain I think you know, the game I mean I mean the game, called, 'Go insane' You should try this little game Just close your eyes forget your name Forget the world, forget the people And we'll erect, a different steeple This little game is fun to do Just close your eyes, no way to lose And I'm right there, I'm going too Release control, we're breaking through Way back deep into the brain Back where there's never any pain And the rain falls gently on the town And over the heads of all of us And in the labyrinth of streams Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around Reptiles abounding Fossils, caves, cool air heights Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled Beast car locked in against morning All now sleeping Rugs silent, mirrors vacant Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples Wound in sheets And daughters, smug With semen eyes in their nipples Wait There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town, we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do, but Run, run, run Let's run, let's run House upon the hill, moon is lying still Shadows of the trees Witnessing the wild breeze C'mon baby run with me Let's run Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs And you won't know a thing till you get inside Dead President's corpse in the driver's car The engine runs on glue and tar C'mon along, we're not going very far To the East to meet the Czar Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake The minister's daughter's in love with the snake Who lives in a well by the side of the road Wake up, girl! We're almost home We should see the gates by mornin' We should be inside by evening Sun, sun, sun Burn, burn, burn Burn, burn, burn I will get you Soon, soon, soon I am the lizard king I can do anything We came down The rivers and highways We came down from Forests and falls We came down from Carson and Springfield We came down from Phoenix enthralled And I can tell you The names of the Kingdom I can tell you The things that you know Listening for a fistful of silence Climbing valleys into the shade For seven years, I dwelt In the loose palace of exile Playing strange games with the girls of the island Now, I have come again To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise Brothers and sisters of the pale forest Children of night Who among you will run with the hunt? Now night arrives with her purple legion Retire now to your tents and to your dreams Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth I want to be ready",en,Rock
