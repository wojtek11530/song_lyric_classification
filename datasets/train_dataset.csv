We're almost home We should see the gates by mornin' We should be inside by evening Sun, sun, sun Burn, burn, burn Burn, burn, burn I will get you Soon, soon, soon I am the lizard king I can do anything We came down The rivers and highways We came down from Forests and falls We came down from Carson and Springfield We came down from Phoenix enthralled And I can tell you The names of the Kingdom I can tell you The things that you know Listening for a fistful of silence Climbing valleys into the shade For seven years, I dwelt In the loose palace of exile Playing strange games with the girls of the island Now, I have come again To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise Brothers and sisters of the pale forest Children of night Who among you will run with the hunt?

Testify to the bleeding heart inside We cart, we scratched, we ran, we slashed and when he opened up at last Found a cul-de-sac deep and black, smoke and ash Deep and black, smoke and ash The wicked King of Parody is kissing all his enemies On the seventh day of the seventh week The tyrant's voice is softer now but just for one forgiving hour Before the rise of his iron fist again, fist again I've to come tonight, I've come to know the way we are, the way we'll go And to measure this width of the wide abyss I come to you in restless sleep where all your dreams turn bittersweet With voodoo doll philosophies day glow holy trinities The crooked raft that leaves the shore, ferries drunken souls aboard Pilgrims march to compostle visions of their Saint in yellow Follow deep in trance lost in a catatonic dance Know no future damn the past, blind, warm, ecstatic, safe at last",en,

2642,ML1132,MoodyLyrics4Q,New Birds,Arab Strap,Indie,,,,,sad,negative,"You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our  new birds She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thing",en,Pop
